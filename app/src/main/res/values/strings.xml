    <string name="about">
        The Virginia Tech studio of Design For America is proud to present See[k]\n\n

        See[k] aims to help you make informed decisions about your mode of transportation, helping
        your daily commute and the planet. See[k] began in 2012 as an application project for
        Virginia Tech students to create an official Design For America studio. Since then,
        the project has gone through many iterations and team members. The primary focus of the
        See[k] team is a system of wayfinding signs in and around Blacksburg, VA that provide
        walking, biking, driving, and possibly bus times for travelling to and from the Virginia
        Tech campus. We aim to have some signs installed by late 2015.
